## About
This little project helps to communicate during the 2 weekly aquarium water exchange procedure.
Normaly I have to shout commands very loud from the living room through the apartment to reach my son at the water tap in the bathroom.

I have to give commands to start or stop water both for draining dirt water and for refilling with freshwater.

So there are to modes to operate: drain and fill
With water flow to be: started and stoped

## NeoPixel
The NeoPixel shows a yellow frame to drain old water and a blue fram for refilling fresh water.
Inside this frame it shows green for starting water flow and red for stopping.
